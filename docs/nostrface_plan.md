# NostrFace: A Tinder-like Profile Browser for Nostr

## Project Overview
NostrFace is a Flutter application that allows users to discover interesting profiles in the Nostr network using a Tinder-like swiping interface. Users can browse profiles, view content, and connect with creators they find interesting.

## Core Features

### 1. Profile Discovery
- Swipeable card interface (similar to Tinder)
- Profile cards showing key user information:
  - Profile picture
  - Name/username
  - Short bio
  - Number of followers/following
  - Recent content preview
- Right swipe to "like" (follow/save profile)
- Left swipe to "pass" (dismiss profile)

### 2. Profile Recommendation Algorithm
- Initial random sampling from well-connected relays
- Content-based filtering based on user interests
- Collaborative filtering based on profiles that similar users have liked
- Option to filter by content types, topics, or interests

### 3. User Authentication
- Connect with existing Nostr private key
- Generate new Nostr keys for new users
- NIP-07 extension support for web version
- Secure key storage using platform-specific security features

### 4. Profile Viewing
- Detailed profile view on tap
- Timeline of recent posts
- List of popular content
- Following/follower information
- Direct message option

### 5. Social Features
- Follow profiles directly
- Save profiles to lists
- Share profiles via other apps
- View mutual connections

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Frontend (Flutter)
- **State Management**: Riverpod or Bloc
- **UI Components**: 
  - Custom card swipe implementation
  - Cached network images for profiles
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Infinite scrolling on profiles

### 2. Nostr Integration
- **Library**: Implement Nostr protocol using a Flutter compatible library (create or adapt existing libraries)
- **Events**: 
  - KIND 0: Profile metadata
  - KIND 1: Text notes
  - KIND 3: Follows
  - Custom kinds as needed
- **Relay Management**:
  - Connect to multiple relays
  - Intelligent relay selection
  - Caching strategy for offline use

### 3. Data Layer
- **Local Storage**: 
  - Hive or SQLite for caching profiles and content
  - Secure storage for key management
- **Remote Data**:
  - Nostr relay connections
  - Optional centralized recommendation service

### 4. Offline Support
- Cache viewed profiles
- Store user preferences locally
- Queue follow/unfollow actions for sync when online

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Setup Flutter project with basic architecture
- Implement Nostr client library or integrate existing one
- Create key management system
- Basic UI skeleton with navigation

### Phase 2: Core Experience
- Implement swipeable card interface
- Build profile fetching and display
- Create basic profile recommendation system
- Setup local caching

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Implement advanced recommendations
- Add detailed profile view
- Develop follow/unfollow functionality
- Implement offline support

### Phase 4: Refinement
- UI/UX polish
- Performance optimization
- Security audit and improvements
- User testing and feedback implementation

## Deployment Strategy

### iOS Deployment
1. **Development Requirements**:
   - Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
   - Xcode on macOS
   - iOS certificates and provisioning profiles

2. **App Store Submission Process**:
   - Create App ID in Apple Developer Portal
   - Configure app signing
   - Complete App Store Connect listing
   - Prepare screenshots and marketing materials
   - Submit for App Review (allow 1-2 weeks for review)

3. **iOS-Specific Considerations**:
   - Secure Enclave for key storage
   - Apple design guidelines compliance
   - Privacy policy requirements
   - App tracking transparency implementation

### Android Deployment
1. **Development Requirements**:
   - Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time fee)
   - Android Studio
   - Keystore for signing

2. **Google Play Submission Process**:
   - Create app listing in Google Play Console
   - Configure app signing
   - Complete store listing
   - Upload APK/App Bundle
   - Submit for review (typically 1-3 days)

3. **Android-Specific Considerations**:
   - Various screen size support
   - Android Keystore for secure key storage
   - Adaptive icons
   - Target API level requirements

### Alternative Distribution
- **F-Droid**: For open-source distribution on Android
- **TestFlight**: For beta testing on iOS
- **Direct APK**: For Android users without Google Play
- **Web Version**: Consider PWA version using Flutter web

## Challenges and Considerations

### Privacy and Security
- Secure storage of Nostr private keys
- Clear information on data usage
- Transparent relay connections
- Option to use only specific relays

### Scalability
- Efficient relay connection pooling
- Smart caching to reduce bandwidth usage
- Optimized image loading and processing

### User Experience
- First-time user onboarding
- Clear explanation of Nostr for new users
- Intuitive profile navigation
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Monetization Options (if needed)
- Premium features (advanced filters, themes)
- Optional donation mechanism
- Sponsored profile promotion (with clear labeling)

## Future Expansion
