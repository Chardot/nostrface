# Dart-Nostr Refactoring Summary

## Overview
I've refactored the Nostrface app to use the `nostr` package (dart-nostr) for all Nostr protocol operations instead of custom implementations. This ensures better protocol compliance, reduces code complexity, and leverages well-tested implementations.

## What Was Refactored

### 1. **NostrRelayServiceV2** (`nostr_relay_service_v2.dart`)
- Uses dart-nostr's `Message`, `Event`, `Filter`, `Request`, and `Close` classes
- Proper message parsing with `Message.deserialize()`
- Event filtering using `Filter` class with proper type safety
- Subscription management with dart-nostr's request/response pattern

**Key improvements:**
- Automatic message type detection (EVENT, NOTICE, OK, EOSE)
- Proper filter construction with all NIP-01 fields
- Built-in serialization/deserialization

### 2. **ProfileServiceV2** (`profile_service_v2.dart`)
- Uses dart-nostr's `Event` class throughout
- Contact list creation with `Event.from()` for proper signing
- Event filtering with `Filter` class
- Direct integration with dart-nostr event types

**Key improvements:**
- Automatic event ID generation
- Proper event signing with private keys
- Simplified event creation and validation

### 3. **DirectMessageServiceV2** (`direct_message_service_v2.dart`)
- Uses dart-nostr for creating encrypted direct messages
- Proper NIP-04 event creation with `Event.from()`
- Filter-based message querying
- Real-time message subscription support

**Key improvements:**
- Automatic event signing
- Proper tag handling
- Stream-based real-time updates

### 4. **KeyManagementService** (updated)
- Uses dart-nostr's `Keychain` class
- Handles both nsec and hex key formats automatically
- Proper public key derivation from private keys
- No more custom key handling code

**Key improvements:**
- Built-in nsec/npub support
- Proper secp256k1 operations
- Key validation

### 5. **Removed Custom Code**
- Deleted `nostr_utils.dart` - all functionality now provided by dart-nostr
- Removed custom event ID generation
- Removed custom signing placeholders
- Removed manual JSON serialization for events

## Benefits of Using dart-nostr

1. **Protocol Compliance**: Guaranteed NIP compliance with tested implementations
2. **Less Code**: Removed hundreds of lines of custom protocol code
3. **Better Type Safety**: Strong typing for all Nostr types
4. **Automatic Validation**: Built-in validation for events, keys, and messages
5. **Future-Proof**: Automatic support for new NIPs as the library updates

## Migration Path

The refactored services are available as V2 versions alongside the existing ones:
- `NostrRelayServiceV2` 
- `ProfileServiceV2`
- `DirectMessageServiceV2`

To migrate:
1. Update imports to use V2 services
2. Update any direct `NostrEvent` usage to use dart-nostr's `Event`
3. Replace custom filter objects with dart-nostr's `Filter`
4. Update event creation to use `Event.from()`

## Example Usage

### Creating a signed event:
```dart
final event = nostr.Event.from(
  kind: 1,
  tags: [['p', recipientPubkey]],
  content: 'Hello Nostr!',
  privkey: keychain.private,
);
```

### Creating a filter:
```dart
final filter = nostr.Filter(
  authors: ['pubkey1', 'pubkey2'],
  kinds: [0, 1],
  since: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 7)),
  limit: 100,
);
```

### Subscribing to events:
```dart
final request = nostr.Request('subscription-id', [filter]);
channel.sink.add(request.serialize());
```

## Next Steps

1. Gradually migrate UI components to use V2 services
2. Update tests to use dart-nostr types
3. Remove old service implementations once migration is complete
4. Consider using more dart-nostr features like NIP-05 verification
