# Testing Follow Functionality

## What was fixed:

1. **Integrated dart-nostr library** for proper event signing and ID generation
2. **Updated KeyManagementService** to use dart-nostr's Keychain for:
   - Handling nsec/hex private keys
   - Deriving public keys properly
   - Providing signing capabilities

3. **Updated ProfileService** to use dart-nostr's Event.from() for:
   - Creating properly signed contact list events (kind 3)
   - Generating correct event IDs
   - Ensuring NIP-02 compliance

4. **Added contact list synchronization**:
   - Loads existing follows from relays on login
   - Publishes updated contact lists to all connected relays

## How to test:

1. Login with a private key (nsec or hex format)
2. Navigate to the Discovery tab
3. Click the heart button to follow a profile
4. The app will:
   - Create a proper Nostr contact list event
   - Sign it with your private key using dart-nostr
   - Publish to all connected relays
   - Show success in the console logs

## What you'll see in the console:

```
Publishing contact list event:
  Event ID: <proper sha256 event id>
  Following X profiles
  Tags: X profiles
  Published to relay: wss://relay.damus.io
  Published to relay: wss://nos.lol
  ...
Successfully published to X/10 relays
Followed profile: <pubkey>
```

## Verification:

The follow events are now properly formatted and signed, so they will:
- Be accepted by Nostr relays
- Show up in other Nostr clients
- Be properly associated with your public key

The implementation uses dart-nostr's built-in event creation and signing, ensuring full compatibility with the Nostr protocol.
