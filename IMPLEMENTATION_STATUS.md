## Next Steps

### Upcoming Features
1. **Code Generation**: 
   - Run the build_runner to generate the necessary JSON serialization code

2. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for core services
   - Add widget tests for UI components
   - Add integration tests for the full app flow

3. **Enhanced Nostr Integration**:
   - Implement actual signing of events
   - Add support for creating and publishing events
   - Add support for NIP-07 browser extension

4. **Profile Discovery Improvements**:
   - Implement better profile recommendation algorithm
   - Add filters for profile discovery
   - Add support for saving favorite profiles

5. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Add animations for smoother transitions
   - Improve error handling and loading states
   - Add offline support with better caching

6. **Deployment**:
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Prepare app for App Store and Google Play Store submission
   - Add app icons and splash screens

## Known Issues

1. **JSON Serialization**: Code generation hasn't been run yet, so the app won't compile until `flutter pub run build_runner build` is executed
2. **Placeholder Data**: Some components still use placeholder data instead of actual Nostr data
3. **Limited Testing**: No tests have been written yet
4. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Error handling needs improvement throughout the app
